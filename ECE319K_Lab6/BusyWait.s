// ***********SPIOutCommand*****************
// This is a helper function that sends an 8-bit command to the LCD.
// Inputs: R0 = 32-bit command (number)
//         R1 = 32-bit SPI1->STAT, SPI status register address
//         R2 = 32-bit SPI1->TXDATA, SPI tx data register address
//         R3 = 32-bit GPIOA->DOUTCLR31_0, PA13 is D/C
// Outputs: none
// Assumes: SPI and GPIO have already been initialized and enabled
// Note: must be AAPCS compliant
// Note: using the clear register to clear will make it friendly
SPIOutCommand:
// --UUU-- Code to write a command to the LCD
//1) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address of SPI1->STAT) and check bit 4,
//2) If bit 4 is high, loop back to step 1 (wait for BUSY bit to be low)
//3) Clear D/C (GPIO PA13) to zero, be friendly (R3 has address of GPIOA->DOUTCLR31_0)
//    Hint: simply write 0x2000 to GPIOA->DOUTCLR31_0
//4) Write the command to the SPI data register (R2 has address of SPI1->TXDATA)
//5) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address of SPI1->STAT) and check bit 4,
//6) If bit 4 is high, loop back to step 5 (wait for BUSY bit to be low)

// This is a helper function that sends an 8-bit data to the LCD.

// Note: using the set register to clear will make it friendly
SPIOutData:
// --UUU-- Code to write data to the LCD
//1) Read the SPI status register (R1 has address of SPI1->STAT) and check bit 1,
//2) If bit 1 is low, loop back to step 1 (wait for TNF bit to be high)
//3) Set D/C (GPIO PA13) to one, be friendly (R3 has address of GPIOA->DOUTSET31_0)
//    Hint: simply write 0x2000 to GPIOA->DOUTSET31_0
//4) Write the data to the SPI data register (R2 has address of SPI1->TXDATA)
